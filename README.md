# SurveyMonty

This is a Python wrapper for the SurveyMonkey API. Why the name? Because this
is a wrapper in Python, and Python makes me think of Monty Python. Also,
"monkey" and "Monty" both start with "mon", hence SurveyMonty.

## Note 12/22/14
This is just a workable copy right now. It's not pretty, but it will be soon.

## Todo
