# SurveyMonty

This is a Python wrapper for the SurveyMonkey API. Why the name? Because this
is a wrapper in Python, and Python makes me think of [Monty Python][1]. Also,
"monkey" and "Monty" both start with "mon", hence SurveyMonty.

# Use Cases
This wrapper is very lightweight and provides no object encapsulation of the
responses. Rather, it provides the API methods in Python form, through which
you can obtain the JSON responses and do with them as you please.

```python

2 + 2

```
